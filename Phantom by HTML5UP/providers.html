									<h2>Matthew Stack</h2>
									<p class="title">LLP, PA-C, DHA</p>
									<p>Matthew Stack has a Master's degree in clinical psychology, a Masters in Physician Assistant studies and a Doctorate in Health Administration. Matthew worked as a limited licensed psychologist in Michigan for 15 years providing individual, couple, family and group psychotherapy. In 2000, Matthew went back to school and became licensed as a physician assistant. After PA school, Matt, Sue and their family served on the Navajo Indian Reservation in Northern Arizona for 5 years.  While Matthew has broad experience working   as a family practice PA, his background in psychology made working as a psychiatric PA a natural fit and Matthew has worked extensively with collaborative psychiatrist colleagues.   Due to his dual licensure, Matthew is able to provide both innovative psychotherapies as well as psychiatric medication management.</p>

									  <p> Sue has a bachelor's degree in physical education and community recreation. Sue has worked for many years in our communities helping children and families find expression and joy   through athletics, dance,  recreation and outdoor activities. More recently Sue has been exploring the healing influence of hanging out with our equine friends. She has taken numerous trainings in equine assisted therapeutic recreation. Sue has learned that due to their instinctual grounding, intuitive awareness of their environment, and desire for connection, horses can be a wonderful therapeutic ally.</p>
